**What are you trying to accomplish? Please describe.**
A clear and concise description of what you are trying to do with the plugin. Ex. I'm trying to assign a report to another player.

**Attempted approach**
Please list the steps you have taken:
1. Reported player '....' using command '....'
2. Viewed the report using command '....'
3. Tried to assign the report to '....' using command '....'

**What happens instead of what you intended**
1. A message appears in-game saying '....'
2. A message in the server log appears saying '....'

**Add any log files, error message snippets, configuration files, permission files, and/or screenshots that are relevant**
